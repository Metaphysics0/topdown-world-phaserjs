Learning phaserjs and this is a simple frame / level for a retro top down rpg.

Found these free assets from https://itch.io

## Learning

1. For loading a tileset for a map, use Tiled and export it as json.
2. For loading a spritesheet for a character, create a Texture Atlas using leshylabs and export it as json-hash. Then use phaser's built in `.atlas()` method
